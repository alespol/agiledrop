Create a custom block which will be displayed in the sidebar on event
pages. The block should display how many days are left until the event
starts, example: ‘Days left to event start: 12’. If the event is
in progress (date is the same as current) display ‘The event is in
progress.’. If the event has already ended (date of event has
passed) display ‘The event has ended.’.

Create a service and write a function which gets a date as a parameter
and returns a value, which is then used to display correct string in
the block.

The block should not be cached.
